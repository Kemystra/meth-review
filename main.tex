\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Holistically Analyzing the Carbon Footprint of AI}
\hspace{24pt}The work by Wu et al. (2022) provides a foundational, holistic analysis of the sources of AI's greenhouse gas emissions, shifting the focus beyond prior research that was often limited to the carbon footprint of training a single, massive model. The authors contend that this narrow, model-centric view has become insufficient in the face of the "super-linear growth" of the entire AI ecosystem, a trend characterized by exponential increases in model complexity, vast volumes of training data, and the ever-expanding hardware infrastructure required to support them. To provide a more accurate assessment, their analysis expands the scope to encompass two critical dimensions: the end-to-end machine learning pipeline (from data acquisition to inference) and the full life cycle of the hardware itself. Critically, the authors introduce a practical framework that distinguishes between \textbf{operational carbon}, defined as the emissions from electricity consumed during use, and \textbf{embodied carbon}, which are the often-hidden emissions generated from the entire manufacturing supply chain.

\subsection{Holistically Analyzing the Ecological Costs of AI}
\hspace{24pt}The analysis by Zhuk (2023) offers a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to understanding the hidden ecological costs associated with the development and deployment of AI technologies. Unlike previous studies that often focus narrowly on energy consumption during AI model training, Zhuk expands the scope to include not only the energy-intensiveness of computing operations but also the broader environmental impacts such as the lifecycle emissions of hardware manufacturing, data center energy demands, e-waste generation from rapid equipment obsolescence, and the ecological disruptions caused by AI infrastructure expansion. Importantly, the work highlights how non-renewable energy reliance leads to increased carbon emissions and poses systemic obstacles to sustainable ecological development. Moreover, the study integrates ethical and political-legal dimensions, underscoring how AI-related errors and algorithmic biases can exacerbate environmental injustice and inequality. The author calls for holistic strategies aimed at energy-efficient algorithm design, renewable energy adoption, responsible e-waste management, and the formulation of binding ethical-legal frameworks at multiple governance levels to harmonize AI progress with environmental sustainability.

\section{Research Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection and Sourcing}
\hspace{24pt}Based on the study conducted by Wu et al. (2022), the data was collected from multiple sources, from internal production systems at Meta, external public reports, and experimental modeling to create a holistic view of AI's environmental footprint. The primary data source consisted of extensive internal infrastructure telemetry from Meta's large-scale AI systems, encompassing operational metrics such as data center power consumption logs, GPU utilization rates, model training job durations, and data ingestion bandwidth statistics. To account for the manufacturing footprint, the authors sourced Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data from external databases and manufacturer publications, such as Apple's Product Environmental Reports, which served as a necessary proxy for their own hardware components. For the purpose of comparative analysis, the study also incorporated the publicly available carbon footprint results of other prominent models, including GPT-3 and Meena, to contextualize their own findings. Finally, to model the energy consumption of specific edge-computing use cases like federated learning, the authors constructed their estimations using a combination of experimental measurements, including device power profiles from Android and network bandwidth data from public sources.
\hspace{24pt}In addition, the study by Zhuk (2023) leverages comprehensive data on the environmental impacts of AI that extends to manufacturing supply chains, hardware lifecycle assessments, and ecosystem-level influences. The data collection process integrates metrics of energy consumption and associated carbon emissions at each stage of AI system deployment, including electronic waste generation and renewable energy utilization. Ethical-legal impact data were also considered by incorporating existing regulatory frameworks and case studies on AI-related environmental injuries and risks to communities, thus providing a multidisciplinary dataset that enriches the environmental footprint assessment of AI technologies.

\subsection{Core Methodology and Algorithms} 
\hspace{24pt}Wu et al. (2022) uses a Carbon Footprint Analysis framework that is designed to holistically estimate the carbon footprint of AI, taking into account the complete machine learning (ML) pipeline end-to-end: data collection, model exploration and experimentation, model training, model optimization and run-time inference, while also taking into account the emissions across the life cycle of hardware systems, from manufacturing to operational use. The calculation mechanism is divided into two parts: operational carbon and embodied carbon. Operational carbon is calculated by measuring the total energy consumption, location-based carbon intensity for electricity grids, while using a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) factor of 1.1. On the other hand, embodied carbon (carbon footprint of AI hardware) is quantified using LCA (Life Cycle Analysis). GPU-based AI training systems are assumed to have a similar embodied footprint as Apple's 28-core CPU with dual AMD Radeon GPUs in production, while for CPU-only AI training systems are assumed to have half that amount.  Based on the characterization of model training and inference at Meta, an average utilization rate of 30\% to 60\% over the 3-5 year lifetime for servers. Combining all metrics above, the embodied carbon footprint is estimated to be: 
\begin{equation}
	CO_2^{\text{embodied}} = \sum_i \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Lifetime}} CO_2^{\text{embodied}}(AI_{\text{System}})(i)
\end{equation}
\hspace{24pt}Building upon Wu et al.'s (2022) carbon footprint analysis framework that distinguishes between operational and embodied carbon, Zhuk's study further expands the methodology by incorporating ethical-legal considerations and non-energy ecological costs. The framework integrates a lifecycle assessment (LCA) method for quantifying embodied carbon in AI hardware, accounting for the full manufacturing-to-disposal chain, and includes additional environmental externalities such as e-waste accumulation and resource depletion. The operational carbon footprint is computed with energy consumption data adjusted for grid carbon intensity and power usage effectiveness (PUE). The methodology incorporates a multidisciplinary approach by combining quantitative carbon accounting with qualitative assessments of environmental justice, policy gaps, and ethical implications of AI deployment, thereby enabling a holistic evaluation of AI's environmental and societal impacts.

\section{Result}
\hspace{24pt} Zhuk's analysis shows a range of environmental, ethical and politicallegal issues associated with the training, use and development of artificial intelligence, which consumes a significant amount of energy (mainly from non-renewable sources). This leads to an increase in carbon emissions and creates obstacles to further sustainable ecological development. Improper disposal of artificial intelligence equipment exacerbates the problem of e-waste and pollution of the planet, further damaging the environment. Errors in artificial intelligence algorithms and decision-making processes
lead to environmental injustice and inequality. AI technologies may disrupt
natural ecosystems, jeopardizing wildlife habitats and migration patterns.

\section{Discussions}
\subsection{Advantages of Research Methodologies Used}
\hspace{24pt} The methodology used in Zhuk's research article offers several notable advantages. Its interdisciplinary approach holistically covers not only AI's direct operational carbon footprint but also incorporates lifecycle environmental costs such as hardware manufacturing, e-waste, and ecosystem impacts. Integrating ethical and legal perspectives broadens the scope to include societal and governance dimensions, which is crucial for framing sustainable AI development in a just and responsible manner. This comprehensive and systemic view transcends the limitations of narrowly quantitative carbon footprint studies, enabling a more nuanced understanding of AI's true environmental costs and policy implications.

\subsection{Limitations of Research Methodologies Used}
\hspace{24pt} Despite its strengths, the methodology in Zhuk's research article lacks formal quantitative modeling or formulaic analysis constrains the precision and reproducibility of environmental impact estimates, making it difficult to benchmark findings against other lifecycle assessments. The research primarily relies on secondary data and existing literature, which may limit measurement accuracy and fail to capture emerging empirical evidence from real-time AI deployments. Additionally, the complexity of integrating ethical-legal issues poses challenges for producing clear actionable outcomes and practical guidelines for AI developers and policymakers.

\subsection{Contribution of the Research}
\hspace{24pt} Zhuk's article significantly contributes to the field by emphasizing the hidden ecological costs and linking AI sustainability with environmental justice and regulatory requirements. The holistic framing invites multidisciplinary collaboration and calls for binding ethical-legal frameworks, renewable energy adoption, and responsible e-waste policies. This foundational work lays the groundwork for future studies to combine qualitative depth with rigorous quantitative lifecycle analyses and policy modeling, fostering AI innovation aligned with ecological and social sustainability goals.
