\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Holistically Analyzing the Carbon Footprint of AI}
\hspace{24pt}The work by \textcite{Wu2022} provides a foundational, holistic analysis of the sources of AI's greenhouse gas emissions, shifting the focus beyond prior research that was often limited to the carbon footprint of training a single, massive model. The authors contend that this narrow, model-centric view has become insufficient in the face of the "super-linear growth" of the entire AI ecosystem, a trend characterized by exponential increases in model complexity, vast volumes of training data, and the ever-expanding hardware infrastructure required to support them. To provide a more accurate assessment, their analysis expands the scope to encompass two critical dimensions: the end-to-end machine learning pipeline (from data acquisition to inference) and the full life cycle of the hardware itself. Critically, the authors introduce a practical framework that distinguishes between \textbf{operational carbon}, defined as the emissions from electricity consumed during use, and \textbf{embodied carbon}, which are the often-hidden emissions generated from the entire manufacturing supply chain.
